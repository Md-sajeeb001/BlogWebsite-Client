        Warning of Fraudulent Offers Online
      </h2>
      <p>
        BOLD would like to warn all consumers about offers of fake BOLD products
        online. Such fake products are often offered by users of various online
        auction websites, but also occur on independent homepages. Suppliers of
        fake products often attract consumers with low-priced goods.
      </p>{" "}
      <br />
      <p>
        Users of such platforms and homepages risk that they receive fake
        products of poor quality, often containing components hazardous to
        health and the environment. It also occurs that users make payments in
        advance, but never receive the ordered goods (especially when using
        “B2B” platforms located in Asian countries).
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        BOLD would like to point out that it can only guarantee the authenticity
        of its products purchased through an official BOLD dealer. Therefore,
        BOLD advises consumers to verify the origin of the products and
        reliability of the respective online supplier beforehand. BOLD shall be
        exempted from any liability in this matter.
